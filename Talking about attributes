simply speaking attributes are nothing but the variables but of the class.
two types of attributes 
a. Class              =   Which will be same for all objects or all instances.
b. Instance/Object    =   Which are different for each and every object or instance.

# class is made
class personal_details:
    
    '''This is a docstring which simply states what bthe class is about'''
    '''For an example this class contains details of a person.'''
    
    name = "abhyudaya"  # These are class attributes
    age = 14
    
    def __init__(self,girlfriend): # For instance attributes we have to call init function
        self.girlfriend = girlfriend # gf is a instance attribute

'''Simply speaking init function is automatically called when an object is created for a class.
   it is used to assign values to an attribut for every instance.
   self is nothing but a parameter that is used to call varibles of a class
   inside a class. and maintains different value for diff instances.'''
    
# object creation
obj = personal_details("hema")
obj1 = personal_details("puspha")
print((obj.name).capitalize())
print(obj1.name)
print(obj.girlfriend)
print(obj1.girlfriend)
# for different objects same name is printing this is class attribute.
# but each object is printing diff gf names as this is instancve attribute.

# if u wan tu can change the value of name for a partucular instance but for els eit will be same as alwys.
obj.name = "Abhi"
print(obj.name)
print(obj1.name)
